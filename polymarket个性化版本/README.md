7. ⚠ Choose reasonable location for the bot(Many users faced this problem, read this carefully before setting up the bot):

   For users facing IP address-related access issues with Polymarket due to geographic restrictions, I recommend using [tradingvps.io](https://app.tradingvps.io/link.php?id=11) with the Germany location. This VPS service offers ultra-low latency and is physically close to Polymarket’s servers, ensuring faster response times and a smoother trading experience. It is specifically optimized for traders and easy to set up, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced users looking to avoid IP-based blocks.
